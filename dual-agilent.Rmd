Note: The process is different for Affymetrix and also single-colour Agilent arrays.

Working on data from ["Regional variation in gene expression in the healthy
colon is dysregulated in ulcerative colitis"](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18523026/). As in the study [Agilent-012391](https://gemma.msl.ubc.ca/arrays/showArrayDesign.html?id=321) Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray G4112A was used with dual mode, we need to do 2-colour Agilent analysis.

One of the commercial microarrays for microRNA profiling has been developed by Agilent Technologies. Agilent microarrays use a single-color array protocol and combine a direct labelling method with innovatively designed, in situ-synthesized probes that have minimal sequence bias. [[source]](https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/13/1/151)

For each microRNA, the Agilent microRNA microarray platform makes measurements with a number of different oligonucleotide probes that are replicated a number of times across the array surface. These replicate signals are summarized into a total gene signal (TGS) with the proprietary Agilent Feature Extraction (AFE) image analysis algorithm [4], which makes use of the background corrected signals. [[source](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-12-64#Tab1)]

This TGS could be used for the differential expression analysis without further pre-processing adjustments; however, different studies indicate that normalization of the microRNA data between arrays improves both sensitivity and specificity in comparison with non-normalized data. [[source](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-12-64#Tab1)]

One alternative to the TGS computed by AFE is the robust multiarray average (RMA) proposed by Irizarry et al. [10] for the pre-processing of Affymetrix microarray data [11]. This is what will be used here.

I will follow limma workflow, that is:

### Let us firstly look at the GLP1708_old_annotations.txt file. 
**GPL1708** is a **platform** identifier used in the GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database. It refers to the Agilent-012391 Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray G4112A. This microarray is designed for studying gene expression in humans. The microarray provides a comprehensive view of the human genome based on sequence information from various sources such as RefSeq, Goldenpath, Ensembl, and Unigene. It covers approximately 41,000 unique genes and transcripts, verified and optimized through alignment to the human genome assembly and Agilent's Empirical Validation process. Source and more [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL1708).

As for the data table headers, we can see following:

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GPL1708">
    <img src="images/GLP1708-headers.png" width="400"/>
  </a>
</p>

Some more details:

- **ID**: **Agilent feature number** - This is a unique identifier assigned to each feature on the microarray chip by Agilent Technologies. When conducting gene expression experiments using Agilent microarrays, researchers place biological samples on the microarray chip, and each sample is hybridized to specific probes that are arranged in a grid-like pattern on the chip. The Agilent feature number serves as a way to uniquely identify each of these probes or spots on the microarray. It allows researchers to track and analyze the intensity or signal generated by each probe during the experiment.

- **COL**: Column - Represents the column number where the feature is located on the microarray grid.

- **ROW**: Row - Represents the row number where the feature is located on the microarray grid.

- **GENE_SYMBOL** or **GENE_NAME**: Gene Symbol or Gene Name - These fields provide the names of the genes represented by each feature on the microarray. They are important for identifying genes of interest and interpreting the results of our analysis.

- **CONTROL_TYPE**: Control type - Identifies whether a feature is a control or a sample

- **DESCRIPTION**: Description - This field provides additional descriptive information about each gene, which can be helpful for understanding its function and biological significance.

The file ```GLP1708_old_annotations.txt``` contains annotations associated with the features (genes or probes) represented on the GLP1708 microarray platform. Let us see an example:
```{r}
if(exists("df")) {
  rm(df)
}

df <- fread("./data/GPL1708_old_annotations.txt.gz")
cat("Features/genes count:", tail(df$ID, 1), "\n") #44290 

```
```{r}
head(df)
```
We can see first two rows representing probe types you can find on a genomic Agilent control grid:

**BrightCorner** (e.g. HsCGHBrightCorner)

- Used for orientation purposes. These probes are placed in the corners of the array with a different pattern for each corner.

- These probes are designed to endogenous sequence and are thus species-specific. These probes are predicted to have high signal due to the multiple copies found in the genome.

**Negative controls**

- Structural negative (3xSLv1)

- Usually highly replicated on the array; used to measure on element background. This probe forms a hairpin and does not hybridize well with labeled sample of any species

-  Biological negatives (e.g., NC1_00000002)

- These are probes shown not to have significant signal from any sample tested. These probes are used to estimate on element background.

- Currently there are 82 different negative control NC probes.

- Common practice is to have one highly replicated NC probe (>100) and the other NC probes at lower replication (≈6).

- Reserve negatives (e.g., SM_01)

- There are currently 12 sequences replicated 40 times marked as control type Positive that are reserved negative controls for future potential use as positive controls. They do not show significant signal from any sample tested.

### Lets look at other files in the folder now
```{r}
file_paths[1:5]
```
We see that we have them in the txt extension. As we use dual Agilent (one of the major producers of microRNA arrays) data:

Agilent data is a two color arrays. For two-color arrays it’s slightly more complicated, because you have a pairing of files (red and green channels). Different scanners spit out different formats for this. So the target information will be a little bit different. 
[source](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/agilent-data)

Let us quickly look at the phenotype file:
```{r}
df_pheno <- fread("./GSE11223/GSE11223_newPheno.txt.gz")
head(df_pheno)
```
We need to create target file for analysis.

```{r}
rm(df_target)
df_target <- data.frame(
  FileName = paste0("data/", df_pheno$GSM, ".txt.gz"),
  Treatment = ifelse(df_pheno$Category == 0, "Control", "UC"), 
  GErep = ifelse(df_pheno$Category == 0, 1, 2), 
  Subject = df_pheno$Patient
)

write.table(df_target, file = "Targets.txt", sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE)
head(df_target)
```


```{r}
counts <- table(df_target$Treatment)
print(counts)
```


## Analysis part

```{r}
BiocManager::install("AgiMicroRna")
library("AgiMicroRna")
library("limma")


# targets frame
targets <- readTargets("Targets.txt")
```

RMA algorithm is defined as a 3-step process of:

- (1) background correction

- (2) quantile normalisation

- (3) log2 transformation


### Read Images: convert the data to red-green list (RG-List)

```{r}
# Read from Image Analysis Output Files
RG <- read.maimages(
  targets,
  source = 'agilent.median'
  #green.only = FALSE, # as Platform type : dual mode (default)
  #other.columns = 'gIsWellAboveBG') # retain information about background via gIsWellAboveBG - no data dor this experiment
)
```

```{r}
boxplot(data.frame(log2(RG$Gb)),main="Green background")
```

```{r}
boxplot(data.frame(log2(RG$Rb)),main="Red background")
```
```{r}

```


### Background correction & normalization

As for Bioconductor manual:

- The use of an offset damps the variation of the log-ratios for very low intensities spots towards zero.

- For the purpose of assessing differential expression, we often find backgroundCorrect(RG, method="normexp", offset=50) to be preferable to the simple background subtraction when using output from most image analysis programs.

```{r}
RG.b <- backgroundCorrect(RG,  method="normexp", offset = 16)

plotDensities(RG.b, main="RG Densities\nno normalization")
#Without any normalization there is considerable variation between both channels and between arrays
```

### Within-array normalization
Goal: normalize the M-values for each array separately (correct for systematic variations in the intensity measurements within each microarray slide)
By normalizing the M-values, we make the data comparable across different spots on the same microarray slide.

- reduce technical variation

- obtaining accurate insights into gene expression changes between samples

Required for the traditional log-ratio analysis of two-color data.

Within-array normalisation will take each array (thus, each sample) as its own entity and perform some normalisation procedure separately on each - during this normalisation procedure, information from other arrays / samples in your dataset is not taken into account. [More here.](https://www.biostars.org/p/360602/)


```{r}
# Agilent arrays do not have print-tip groups, so one should use global loess normalization 
MA <- normalizeWithinArrays(RG.b, method="loess")
# Warning: Print-tip loess is also unreliable for small arrays with less than, say, 150 spots per print-tip group

# Any spot quality weights found in RG will be used in the normalization by default. This means for example that spots with zero weight (flagged out) will not influence the normalization of other spots.
plotDensities(MA, main="RG Densities\nwith within-array normalization")

```

Loess normalization assumes that the bulk of the probes on the array are not differentially expressed. It doesn’t assume that there are equal numbers of up and down regulated genes or that differential expression is symmetric about zero, provided that the loess fit is implemented in a robust fashion, but it is necessary that there be a substantial body of probes which do not change expression levels. Oshlack et al [19] show that loess normalization can tolerate up to about 30% asymmetric differential expression while still giving good results. [[source](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/limma/inst/doc/usersguide.pdf)]

### MD-plots
Measuring expression in multiple RNA samples produces columns of correlated expression values, which are highly correlated because they are measured on the same set of genes or genomic features. It has long been established in the biomedical literature that the level of agreement between correlated variables can be usefully examined by plotting differences versus means. [[source](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/43/7/e47/2414268)]

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(3,5))
par(mgp = c(2, 0.4, 0))
par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1) + 0.1)
# "Mean-difference plot\n", 
# plotMD Mean-difference plots. Very versatile plot. For two color arrays, this plots the M-values vs A-values.
# For two color data objects, a within-array MD-plot is produced with the M and A
# values computed from the two channels for the specified array. This is the same as a mean-difference
# plot (mdplot) with the red and green log2-intensities of the array providing the two columns.
# A (log-ratio) M (mean log-intensity)


for (column in 150:length(colnames(MA))) {
  group <- targets$Treatment[grep(paste0("^", filename), targets$FileName)]
  name <- gsub("\\.txt$", "", basename(filename))
  
    limma::plotMD(MA.n, column = column, 
         xlab = "Avg log-expression\n(means)", 
         ylab = "Expression log-ratio\n(this sample vs others)", 
         main = paste0(name, " (", group, ")"),
         cex.main = 0.7,
           cex.lab = 0.8, 
           cex.axis = 0.8  # tick
  )
}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))

```

### Between-Array Normalization

Between-array normalization involves examining data from all samples collectively and devising a method to normalize them as a whole.
Crutial for differential expression analysis.


```{r}
MA.n = normalizeBetweenArrays(MA, method="Aquantile")

plotDensities(MA.n, main="RG Densities\nwith within- and between- \narray normalization")

```


### Filtering unexpressed probes
As per limma manual:
For two-color microarrays, it is usual to use all the available probes during the background
correction and normalization steps. However, control probes that do not correspond to genes are typically removed before proceeding with the differential expression analysis. Other than these control probes, no additional filtering is typically performed at this stage.


```{r}
Control <- MA.n$genes$ControlType==1L
MA.n.filtered <- MA.n[!Control,  ]

paste0("Before: ", dim(MA.n)[1], " After: ", dim(MA.n.filtered)[1])
```
### Use duplicateCorrelation to estimate the intra-array correlation.

### Differential Expression Analysis 

```{r}
design <- model.matrix(~ 0 + factor(targets$Treatment, levels = c('Control', 'UC')))
colnames(design) <- c('Control', 'UC')


fit <- lmFit(
  MA.n.filtered,
  design)

fit <- eBayes(fit) # Bayes method to moderate the standard errors of the estimated log-fold changes
results <- decideTests(fit)

top_genes <- topTable(fit, coef="UC", number=nrow(MA.n.filtered))
top_genes$Place <- 1:nrow(top_genes)


```



One of the most widely-used between-array normalisation methods is quantile normalisation, which is used by the widely known RMA (robust multiarray average) method. In a nutshell, quantile normalisation aims to match the data distribution across all of your samples. This is why, after quantile normalisation, the distributions of your samples usually look quite similar in a box-and-whisker plot.
