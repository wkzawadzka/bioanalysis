### Learning to work with microarrays

What: Notes and learning process :)

### This repo is consiting of following parts:

- (1) Lab materials from the Introduction to R and Bioconductor course held 27-29 January 2010 in Seattle at FHCRC (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center), one of the worldâ€™s leading cancer research institutes. Here I go through [this](https://www.bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2010/SeattleJan10/) course. [in progres... ]

- (2) Pre-processing raw microarray data accessed through GEO

Here the plan is following:

    - dual-probe Agilent microarray data [in progress...]
    - single color Agilent [todo]
    - Affymatrix [todo]

- (3) Introduction to Genomic Technologies by Steven Salzberg, Ph.D. and Jeff Leek, Ph.D. (Coursera) [done in [genomics-intro](https://github.com/wkzawadzka/bioanalysis/tree/master/genomics-intro)]
